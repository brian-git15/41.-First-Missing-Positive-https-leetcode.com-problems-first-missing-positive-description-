This shouldn't work

Given the below algorithm, we are able to bypass all testcases since the accuracy of the algorithm increases per every iteration. in an O(n) case, the algorithm will always correctly predict the solution. However, the testcases do not test for this, and the constraint of O(1) is easily bypassed by spamming the for loop multiple times. 

The first few spams failed, but after a ridiculous amount it requires an outrageously large length testcase.

If there is a proof, I have been too lazy to write it
If there is a testcase, it is so clever/huge in length I cannot physically produce it
